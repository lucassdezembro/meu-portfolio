        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Lucas and I am 17 years old. I am a programmer and started my studies in 2020 at ETEC Ferrucio Humberto Gazzeta in Nova Odessa, SÃ£o Paulo. I fell in love with programming and continue to improve daily.</p>
        <p>I have experience in various technologies and can work as a full-stack developer, but Golang is my main language and I used to use it for back-end development. I am skilled in building REST APIs using microservices architecture, Google Protobuf and Golang. I also have experience in devops tasks including Bitbucket Pipelines, and some experience with Kubernetes and Gcloud, particularly Datastore.</p>
        <p>I also have knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Flutter and Dart.</p>
        <p>ðŸ“š I am currently studying analysis and systems development at EstÃ¡cio university</p>
        <p>ðŸ’¼ I am currently interning at the company Diletta Solutions</p>
